Pre install instructions: V1.1.0
Read the changelog
-If you are running an older version of this service, it is best to backup your minecraft directory (so all your server files) and move them to a safe place, including backups. Completly uninstall any older version before you install another version
-If you are running version 1.0.3+ you can leave the folders alone, they should not be effected.
-If you are running anything before V1.1.0 - while older configuration files should work, it is best to delete the config file and let the latest config file be generated on install

When the installer is run, it is best to leave the installer alone but now is the time to make a change to the install folder.
NOTE: This will not effect the folder structure of the service 

After install
During the installation process, the folder structure should have been generated on your C: drive, it will look like this default
C:\
  -VNMinecraft     (root)
     -Backups      (All backups are handled here)
     -Minecraft    (Your Server instance and all files. NOTE: All files here will be backed up)
     -config.conf  (Main configuration file) 


If you have a previous Minecraft server instance (or backed up instance from earlier), move all the files to the "Minecraft" directory including the server jar file you wish to run.

Once the files have been placed in the directory - open and edit the config.conf file generated in the root folder.

Follow the instructions outlined in the conf file. Make sure the conf file has the same syntax already in the example. If you have concerns, go to the wiki on my git-hub and follow the outlined options there.

***Be aware that the "Minecraft" folder is the default runtime folder for the process, so all your server files must be located here and the config file must point to the jar in this folder, or else it will fail!


After installed and first time config edited

press win + X 
click run
Type "services.msc"

Scroll down to find "VN MC-Server"
 It should be set to automatic (default) to be run autonomously. Optinally you can select delayed start if you want it to wait some time after startup
 Right click and start the service
 If it started successfully, go to your VNMinecraft folder and look at your log file.
 If it failed to start, look at your system even log to see what the error was, if it was unhandled, its likely a bug and you should report it to the issues page on git-hub

In your log file, you should see that everything was successfully verfied and started. You should use the log file to handle configration or system errors in the future, or if your instance failed what you need 
to fix in your configuration file.

You are done! You can open up task manager to make sure your java process is running and you should be good to go!


NOTE: 
  If you are to break the conf file, just manually stop the service, delete it, start the service again. Your log file will say that a config file was not found, make a new one and exit to wait for it to be restarted.
  The config file is only read on startup.

  Once the config is correct the Java JVM will be started with your server instance and all should be good. If there are errors with this config file, hopefully most of them will be caught and logged for you to fix.
  
  Check the log file, you will see all the process took to run your server. The last entry should say something like " Process java with id:xxx is running "

NOTE:
  You may have to update your windows firewall rules for this service


Additional notes
   If you are running 32 bit java binaries, make sure you dont allow more than 4gb of memory to be used and set x64 to false
   
   Personally for windows firewall I prefer force binding the port to the java appliction instead of opening a tcp port to windows for apps to listen on

   DO NOT DELETE THE PROGRAM FOLDER!! If you do, the uninstaller will fail and you wont be able to repair it, you will have to use .NET service delete to remove it. 

   This service uses the Local SYSTEM security account, so typically you shouldnt have system security issues on running. 

ENJOY!!
