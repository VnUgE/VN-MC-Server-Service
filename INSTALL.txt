When the installer is run, typically the default location is best, but pick a place somewhere in the root file system (c drive) and install the service

The VNMinecraft directory defaulted to your c drive is the directory where your server files are stored. 
(for advanced users, the service exe accepts argument 0, so you can sepcify your custom runtime directory path if you would like to change this directory)

Open File Explorer and go to your c drive.
You shoud see a folder named VNMinecraft.
In this directory, you should see 2 more directories and a config file. 
   The Backups directory is where the backup engine will create your backups 
   The Minecraft directory is where your Minecraft server instance will be run from

If you have a previous Minecraft server instance, copy all the files to the "Minecraft" directory including the server jar file you wish to run.

Once the files have been placed in the directory - open and edit the config.conf file generated in the root folder.

Follow the instructions outlined in the conf file. Make sure the conf file has the same syntax already in the example.

After installed and config edited

press win + X 
click run
Type "services.msc"

Scroll down to find "VN MC-Server"
 It should be set to automatic to be run autonomously. Optinally you can select delayed start if you want it to wait some time after startup
 Right click and start the service
 Open File Explorer and go to your c drive.
 You shoud see a folder named VNMinecraft.
 If you see the folder - right click and stop the service.


NOTE: 
  If you are to break the conf file, just delete it, START then STOP the service again and it will generate a new config file. The config file is only read on startup.

  Once the config is correct the Java JVM will be started with your server instance and all should be good.
  
  Check the log file, you will see all the process took to run your server. The last entry should say something like " Process java with id:xxx is running "

NOTE:
  You may have to update your windows firewall rules for this service


Additional notes
   If you are running 32 bit java binaries, make sure you dont allow more than 4gb of memory to be used and set x64 to false
   
   Personally for windows firewall I prefer force binding the port to the java appliction instead of opening a tcp port to windows for apps to listen on

   DO NOT DELETE THE PROGRAM FOLDER!! If you do, the uninstaller will fail and you wont be able to repair it, you will have to use service delete to remove it. 

   This service uses the Local SYSTEM security account, so typically you shouldnt have issues with security. 

ENJOY!!
